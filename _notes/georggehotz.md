1000$ to talk to him for 30 minutes

I don't think P = [NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)

## Philosophy

- **Do you think time is an illusion?**
	- *Time is an useful model to describe reality.*

Someday someone is going to make a model of all the stuff I said on stream. Maybe soon.


- **Do you think there's a subjective reality?**
	- *I do not know. I do not think it matters.*

## AI

- AI will not be autonomous, that's too ScFi. (remember Nicu's "asta e fier")
- AlphaGo were = much more impressive than ChatGPT because it was playing beyond the level of any human, while LLMs are writing mediocre code and essays
- AI accelerators = software problem, not a hardware problems
- Why is harder to replace a boyfriend than a girlfriend with an artificial LMM?
- Because women are attracted to status and power.
- And men are attracted to youth and beauty. 
- Loves virtual reality, would like to live there. Unfortunately, we are very far away from that at this point in time.
- We can reproduce audio well. The eye is more powerful and we haven't achieved that yet.
- I want AI friends that are smarter than I am 
- What it means to be human is going to start to get weird 
- You want to subjugate people, not to have complete destruction.
- It is not the nature of AI, but the nature of humanity --– to press the red button 
- We might stop reproducing. But George thinks that Wireheading is more likely. We are going to get stuck scrolling through that infinite TikTok
- Calculators can add better than a lot of people.
- The niche that makes humans special is getting smaller.
- AI can reason better than a lot of people.
- Language is like chess.
- AI people who are concerned about safety and decentralisation will end up [paperclipped](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/ai-and-paperclip-problem).
- AI will generate memes.
- We are going to build the TikTok that you cannot take your eyes off of.
- You cannot imagine the behaviors of something smarter than you.
- Agrees with [Eliezer Yudkowski](craftdocs://open?blockId=FD807FAA-9FE4-4E38-B583-DC286D1469AA&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) about AI being able to end humanity, but for a different reason.
- If you go back to 1960 and show top chess grandmasters that you have a machine that can play incredible chess, they will think the machine is intelligent. If you show the same machine to someone in 2010, they won't think the same. 
- When someone make an LMM that's capable of citing its sources, that will kill Google. Isn't [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) doing that?
	- All of this together makes GPT-4 a really powerful tool that can do a lot of amazing things!

## The Internet, social media and toxicity

- If you took all the money from crypto, it would have been a beautiful place.
- The internet used to be a much cooler before corporations came in. 
- Right now, Microsoft is doing the best for the programming world, the improvements to Python, VSCode, Github. Who would have taught that Microsoft and Meta are spearheading  the open source movement?
- I would not be surprised if over the next 5 years Bing will overtake Google
- If it is no longer visceral, I can no longer do it. I viscerally love programming. 
- We should have intelligence control. We should give intelligence to good people. And that is a horrifying idea. 
- Intelligence agencies don't necessarily have the latest technologies, but they have more patience and endurance to deploy and stick to the plan.
- If someone is telling me what they saw on the news, I simply repeat: CIA psyop, CIA psyop, even if that's not true. They are trying to influence your mind.
- I delete me tweets because the algo promotes toxicity. 
- By the end of the decade, maybe Google won't be dominating search.
- I would put my money on Mark Zuckerberg. Google is dead. Mark Zuckerberg is alive and you can see him pivoting.
- Who would have thought that Mark Zuckerberg would be the good guy? 
- Lex said that he had a convo with Mark and he said that he is all in on open source. 
- Do we have a button to turn off Google?
- Maybe Mark Zuckerberg has the power to turn off Meta more than the CEO of Google has the power to turn off Google. 
- [Elon Musk](craftdocs://open?blockId=7457D12B-1A85-4A9D-8701-9AC3893D6C1E&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) has the button too. 
- this is based on a [Paul Graham](craftdocs://open?blockId=87AB3905-F311-4DD8-AFCA-F3B3C145C222&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) essay called [Default alive or default dead](http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html)
- You gotta figure out how to maximize for something other than toxicity. 
- As soon as you charge people money, they are not the product, they are the customer.
- [Sam Altman](craftdocs://open?blockId=B768A6F4-5818-4F93-8EB8-B62DF9118617&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) won't tell you that GPT4 has 220 billion parameters and is a 16-way mixture model with eight sets of weights.

	**Note:** 


	- Imagine you have a big box with many drawers inside it. The box can answer questions and complete tasks that you give it.
	- GPT-4 is like a super big box with 220 billion drawers inside it. Each drawer has a special piece of information stored inside it that helps the box answer questions and complete tasks.
	- In order to make sure the box works really well, it has 16 different ways of combining information from those drawers. It's like having 16 different helpers who can each find information in the drawers and work together to answer your questions and complete your tasks.
	- Each of those 16 helpers has 8 different sets of instructions for how to find and combine information from the drawers. It's like having 8 different ways each helper can look through the drawers and pick out what they need.
- The only 2 companies that have endured are Apple and Microsoft. They make computers and services. If you want to endure, build hardware.
- Twitter is now a monarchy instead of an oligarchy 
- Facebook has the best code, then Google, then Twitter
- There are people in the world who thrive under complexity. Lawyers want things to be complex so that they can have more things to do and charge more for their services.
- Look at the machine learning frameworks: 
	- Facebook released PyTorch
	- Google released TensorFlow
	- Twitter released…?

## [On TinyCorp](https://tinygrad.org)

- TinyCorp - make sure that power stays decentralized
- What happens if Nvidia becomes nationalized? 
- Everything I can do to decentralize power --- I am happy to do. 

Descriptions of computation: 3 kinds of computation paradigms


1. CPUs = add and multiply, load and store, compare and branch
2. GPUs
3. [DSPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processor)

A nuclear weapon is not a defence against a nuclear weapon. Maybe in a mind-game kind of way. 

### **What's the meaning of life?**

- To win. I haven't figure out what the game is.  
- Maybe the game is to stay eye to eye with God. 
- I want my creations to stay eye to eye with me. So why wouldn't God want to stay eye to eye with us?

## Ideology

- [Effective altruism](craftdocs://open?blockId=ACEDB832-8B0C-4B66-A68A-2877BE3BD48E&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) is an evil ideology

I wish there were more [Elon Musk](craftdocs://open?blockId=7457D12B-1A85-4A9D-8701-9AC3893D6C1E&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234)s on Earth. 


- Sam Bankman Fried is the the embodiment of [Effective altruism](craftdocs://open?blockId=ACEDB832-8B0C-4B66-A68A-2877BE3BD48E&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) and he is in jail
- [Utilitarianism](craftdocs://open?blockId=B109E969-7460-4778-834F-216F7C8CA822&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) is an abhorrent ideology
- Charity is something bad
- I would replace [Effective altruism](craftdocs://open?blockId=ACEDB832-8B0C-4B66-A68A-2877BE3BD48E&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) with [Effective accelerationism](craftdocs://open?blockId=AF776517-49BA-4D09-A174-3B7B955309E3&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234)
	- [Accelerationism](craftdocs://open?blockId=55BC0710-E2C8-4863-BF29-AE8CBA66FCCC&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) is the only thing that lifted people out of poverty
	- I'd rather die than need [UBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income) to survive
	- you can make survival guaranteed by making housing and food dirt cheap; [Accelerationism](craftdocs://open?blockId=55BC0710-E2C8-4863-BF29-AE8CBA66FCCC&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) can solve that
- I am pretty centrist, but if there's one political stance I cannot stand is deceleration i.e. people who believe we should use less energy. Not people who believe global warming is a problem. How do I pay 20 cents for a megawatt hour? 
- I'll take anarchy over tyranny. 
- [Andrej Karpathy](craftdocs://open?blockId=8EE2603A-2EE7-4317-B3EF-5EC9AA3AC3F6&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234) wants to teach you. I just want to prove that I am smarter than you. But he went to work for [OpenAI](craftdocs://open?blockId=5366725F-6CF2-4D06-910D-587AA8333A9C&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234). 

### On nature

- Nature has been fine-tuned for billions of years.
- Everything running in the universe is computation.
- Mid is bad. Middle is bad.

### On consciousness

- If consciousness is spectrum, I am a lot more conscious than most people are.
- I do not think I'm conscious.
- Humans want to believe so much that people think that large language models are conscious. That's how much humans want to believe.
- LMM are less conscious than a chicken
- The amount of diversity on the planet is decreasing.

### Eating & Gaming

- loves pizza, cheese pizza (Chicago deep dish pizza)
- World of Warcraft is the greatest game of all time. It opened my mind to possibilities. 
- Also enjoys Skyrim and GTA V

### On God

- I don't think that AI will kill the human species. That's quite hard to do. AI might kill everything we call society today. AI might have very strong taboos against technology.  Technology is the devil and nature is God. That's what they might say.
- How can game creators be atheists when they create worlds?
- Of course we were created by God, it is the most obvious thing
- Our tech is not robust enough. We cannot build an AI that goes out in nature and survives like a bird. A bird is robust. We haven't built a machine that's capable of reproducing. It seems we will get super-intelligence before we get robustness.
- OpenAI used AI safety when GPT 2 came out to hype up their company. 
- All of life is capable of reproducing without having to go to a repair shop.
- Life will continue to reproduce in the complete absence of civilization. Robots might not.
- Improving the FAB might be the solution. But this is a very difficult problem --– having a robot that can built itself up. A 3D printer that prints a 3D printer.

**2 stacks of life in the world:**


- the biological stack
- the silicone stack

The path from rationality to polyamory does not make sense for me.

Culture is whatever we define it as.

### **Programming**

- cannot program with ChatGPT; too much noise
- I value simplicity
- I use VS Code
	- VSCode autocomplete is okay 90% of the time
	- I do not want TAB autocomplete to my code
	- what I want is a very intelligent pair programmer telling me via a pop-up "hey, you have a bug on line 14 and here's what it is"
- Python is the closest thing to pseudocode
- programmers will become obsolete, read [A casino Odyssey in cyberspace](http://localroger.com/k5host/casodycs.html)
- prompt engineering is the future
- AI is the "do what I mean" machine
- I am an anarchist in the digital world, not in the physical world
