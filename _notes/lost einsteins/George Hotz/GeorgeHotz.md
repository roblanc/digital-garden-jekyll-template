## Quotes & other bits 

*It’s no longer about all nighters, powering through with brute force, sparring with elegance, winning and losing, all within grasp yet all not…I’m probably delusional but you wouldn’t start a company otherwise, right?
*
*It’s no longer a race car, it’s a boat. And steering a boat requires too much damn *planning* and *patience*. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXqkTzyifJQ) is my favorite Rick and Morty clip. If comma succeeds, it really never was me, it’s the people there who can drive boats. As I am with the world, I am a cheerleader and court jester.
