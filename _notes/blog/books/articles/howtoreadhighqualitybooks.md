[Sturgeon’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law#:~:text=Sturgeon's law (or Sturgeon's revelation,science fiction author and critic.) is a philosophical aphorism that states that 90% of everything is crap. And, of course, you should take this with a grain of salt.

> “All things — cars, books, cheeses, hairstyles, people and pins are, to the expert and discerning eye, crud, except for the acceptable tithe which we each happen to like.”

> *— From Theodore Sturgeon’s “On Hand: A Book” (published in Venture Science Fiction, September* *[1957](https://archive.org/details/Venture_v01n05_1957-09_Gorgon776/)**, Vol. 1, №5, pp. 49–50)*

[Sturgeon’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_law#:~:text=Sturgeon's law (or Sturgeon's revelation,science fiction author and critic.) can still be an interesting framework to keep in mind just in case you might randomly go on a book buying spree. If you are looking to start a personal kit of frameworks you can use to read both more books and articles, you should start with filtering out the fluff first.

Sure, you can choose semi-random consumption and use speed & skimming to consume your book faster while also increasing your chances of finding a new gem. But most of the books today are not that good. As there are various ways to make a book look good.

In comparison with the good old days when a book had to be written by hand first, then involve the printing press, the shipping, the reading, and re-reading by millions of people so that one can end up saying something like ‘yes, this book is good’ and stood the test of time.

# **Conclusion**

Now, I admit, I do not do this for every single book. I am not that mad.

Creating a framework where you are able to go straight to the most emblematic error-free books as you can is a nice tool to have in your back pocket. Filtering out the fluff, while also reinforcing what is clean and scientifically correct.

For the general population, in a world ruled by chaos theory, it is quite easy to say that a constellation has a strong effect on your life and find correlations everywhere. A banana falling from a tree in India could also have an influence on your life as well — in principle. But this is not useful on a scientific level, as you can run into all kinds of practical problems.

So keeping an open mind while also trying to clean up that 90% of everything which Sturgeon outlined as crap, can be an overall great to consider while deciding what book you should consume next.
