Those are Scooby-snacks for your hard-working soul.

Many problems of focusing are best solved by defining what to ignore. Ignore: the news, complainers, angry people, high-conflict people.

Try getting out of your head and into your body. Go out and move.

Ignore the unfairness - there is no fair. Play the hand that you're dealt to the best of your ability. People are highly consistent, so you will eventually get what you deserve and so will they. In the end, everyone gets the same judgment: death.

I do not have time for short-term things: dinners with people I won't see again, tedious ceremonies to please tedious people, traveling to places that I wouldn't go to on vacation.

**Be the change you want to see in the world.**

We need a new diversity - not one based on biological characteristics and identity politics but a diversity of opinion and worldviews.

Ego is about who's right. Truth is about what's right.

Formula for failure: try to please everyone all the time.

One should use common words to say uncommon things.

Make sure you have something every day you are looking forward to. Maybe it's your job, maybe it's a basketball game after work or a voice lesson or your writing group.

We can't control the fact that bad things are going to happen, but it's how we react to them that really matters.

It's vain to do with more what can be done with less.

Learning to ignore things is one of the greatest paths to inner peace.

Learn more, know less.

Making a good list. It's a lot more satisfying for me to have something written down on paper that I can forcibly cross off when it's done.

We may be approaching a time when sugar is responsible for more early deaths in America than cigarette smoking.

Creation is a better means of self-expression and possession; it is through creating, not possessing, that life is revealed.

Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life.

To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.

The single most important distinction in life... is to distinguish between an opportunity to be seized and a temptation to be resisted.

One distraction I've learned to avoid is consuming media that's just telling me things I already know and agree with.

Good judgment is what allows you to evaluate whether a recommendation is appropriate to your situation or not; without it, you can't tell the difference between good and bad advice.

A pair of [Beats Solo3](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=beats+solo+3&oq=beats+solo+3+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1664j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) changed my life.

When two extreme opinions meet, the truth lies generally somewhere in the middle. Without exposure to the other side, you will naturally drift toward the extremes and away from the truth.

Every smart person and stable person I know both walk and meditates. The app Headspace is a fun way to start. Try and do it every day. But I suggest not doing it while you  are walkig...for now.

The man who grasps principles can successfully handle his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.

I get endless delight covertly ambushing unsuspecting strangers with random acts of kindness. So, for example, after ordering my iced latte, I’ll give a Starbucks barista a $20.00 bill and tell him or her to comp the person right after the person behind me for whatever he or she wants, and to give that person the change as well. I don’t do the person immediately behind me, who might suspect that I was the mystery benefactor. Then, I sit my latte from afar and watch the confusion give way to smiles when the random beneficiary realizes the unexpected bounty. Sometimes, the person leaves all of the change as a tip. Sometimes, he or she will pay it forward and gift the next person behind a free coffee, but the beneficiary always leaves smiling broadly, and I know that I’ve unleashed a positive ripple effect in that person’s community and to anyone he or she encounters that day. I love spreading the magic.

When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, what do you do? I change my physiology. If I am near waves, I go surf them. If not, a short, intense kettlebell workout, a bike ride, a swim, a cold shower or ice plunge, Wim Hof or heart rate variability breathing [see Adam Robinson, for a description]. It’s remarkable how the mind follows the body.

If you think you are to small to be effective, you have never been in the dark with a mosquito.

Watch what people are cynical about and one can discover what they lack.

Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.

Focus on writing skills. It's the one thing I've found that really helps people stand out. More and more communication is written today. Get great at presenting yourself with words, and words alone, and you'll be far ahead of the most.

Be more mindful about your relationship with technology.

Macro patience, micro speed.

Every morning I try to take a picture of a flower and post it on Instagram. This teaches me how to pause.

When I roll out of bed, I do the plank for two minutes.

Think small. Do something cool by the end of the day.

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

I ask myself: What is the most loving thing I can do for myself and others right now? Then I get to it.

Always take jobs which you are not qualified; that way you will inevitably learn something.

A belief: we are all mini gods. We get to create our realities.

The world is already full of marketers and businessmen. The world doesn't need more of that. The world needs healers and problem-solvers.

Give up sodas.

The great majority of that which gives you angst never happens.

Attitude puts aptitude on steroids.

I brush my teeth standing on one leg, alternating each time. It is great for your legs, core, and stabilization.

The actual consequences of your actions matter far more than your actions themselves.

A deontologist believes that for something to be ethically correct, it must abide by a predefined set of moral rules or ideologies, and if an action breaks those rules then it is immoral, regardless of the outcome.

A [consequentialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism) believes that the moral value of an action purely depends on its outcome - the act itself does not carry moral weight, all that matters is whether its consequences are good or bad overall.

For example, say there's an axe-murderer who's about to kill a number of victims unless you kill the murderer first. A strict deontologist would say, ''Killing a person is always wrong, regardless of why it is done.'' A consequentialist would say, "Killing a person is wrong, because the outcome usually causes suffering."

If I really don't like something, or if something doesn't agree with me, I just walk away or talk to someone more positive.

Stop looking at your phone.

The less you need positive feedback on your ideas, the more original design regions you can explore, and the more creative and, in the long term, useful to society you will be.

The idea that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is not real.

Avoid sugar. Especially soda and juice. All other diet advice is noise.

Grab a sweet potato when you feel the need form something sweet.

Saying *no* to everything that does not energize me personally or creatively.

Industries are led by expert - that is not true.

You can do so much in ten minutes’ time. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. Divide your life into 10-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.

We all should reassess what we think and believe constantly–in politics, in life, and in our thinking. Otherwise, we get too rigid.

I lift hard, go for a run, read a book, get a massage or watch a movie.

I try to be realistic optimist: I'm very clinical about where we are today, but extremely optimistic about what we're going to get done in the future.

No one is qualified to tell you how you experience the world - Vlad Zamfir

There is a precise reality of which behaviors and intentions are reasonable or absurd in any given context. Thinking of them in binary or quantitative way is still very useful.

Absurdism provides a clear philosophy of failure: either the intention was absurd, the strategy was not reasonable, or it was reasonable but was not executed correctly.

If I become confident that my intention is absurd, then I give up. Deliberately, if I have to. If I think it's not absurd, I'll continue trying strategies I think might be reasonable, and I will practice the strategies I highly suspect are reasonable, if I really care about bearing out my intention.

It says that there are contexts where having intentions is absurd. That sometimes rationality is absurd, and should therefore be abandoned. In these contexts, it doesn't make sense to decide what to do or how to spend your time, if by that you mean ''pick a goal that you want to achieve.''

I have found absurdism to be unreasonably effective for doing mathematics, maintaining relationships, dealing with ignorance, reasoning about ethics, dealing with depression, and living a happier life.

The most of what you are currently learn at school will be irrelevant by the time you are 40.

The secret in winning any game is no trying to hard.

Tim’s conclusion was also one of my favourite parts of the book:

"Based on everything I’ve seen, a simple recipe can work: focus on what’s in front of you, design great days to create a great life, and try not to make the same mistake twice. That’s it. Stop hitting net balls and try something else, perhaps even the opposite. If you really want extra credit, try not to be a dick, and you’ll be a Voltron - level superstar.

Feeling as though you are trying too hard indicates that your priorities, technique, focus, or mindfulness is off. Take it as a cue to reset, not to double down. And take comfort in the fact that, whenever in doubt, the answer is probably hidden in plain sight.

What would this look like if it were easy?

In a world where nobody really knows anything, you have the incredible freedom to continually reinvent yourself and forge new paths, no matter how strange. Embrace your weird self.

There is no one right answer... only better questions."
