## hello again.

[[Notes from books]] - A bazaar of bottled brilliance and bracketed bits of brilliance distilled from a broad buffet of brainy breadths. 

You've managed to find your way into my working notes, which I've accumulated over the course of several years. This database is part of my endeavor to arrange my own notions and ideas in a more public place where I can link notes on various topics together. These are in a constant state of flux. I also post/experiment with visual stuff [on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertBlanc), ideas and theories that interest me. I use it to alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.


If you want to hear about what I'm building, writing, and thinking about each week, then my Newsletter âžœ [here](https://linkincubator.substack.com/) ðŸ«€
