I am generally interested in anything that doesn't reduce my optionality and things that you can do once that work in perpetuity.

This page is a basic tl;dr of my philosophical foundation. So yeah.

### **My current nano-philosophy**

**Created**: 2019/4/3
**Last** **updated:** [Sat, 20 May](day://2023.05.20)
**Status**: In progress

### **Foundations**

 - **Part I**
  1. I exist.
  2. I have an experience.
  3. I want to maximize my experience.
 - **Part II**
  1. Other humans exist.
  2. Other humans have an experience like mine.
  3. Other humans want to maximize their experience.
 - **Part III**
  1. Humans synergize to create better experiences.
  2. If I synergize with others, it will maximize my experience.
  3. Others will synergize with me to maximize their experience.

### **On Age**

 - Age really is just an anxiety-inducing number. Feeling like you need to have your life figured out by the time you're 20, comparing yourself to other people your age, stressing about turning 30, and feeling like you are officially no longer "young". A way for people to put you into a convenient box.
 - I understand that if you want to function in society, you need to keep track of things. Sometimes I feel like I do not even need to have a name. If I have a group of people that really know me, they don't need to call me anything. I suppose I like not to be bound by stuff that other people bring on you.
 - There is no day, there is no night. I am trying not to bind myself to the arbitrary calculations of cycles and sequences which are ultimately imaginary. It is easier for me to say that a day doesn't end when the moon is out, and the day doesn't begin when the sun rises. It is all a continuous flow. Not chopped up into pieces.
 - I do enjoy being alone and have a tendency toward a solitary or sheltered lifestyle.
 - I am indeed a walking contradiction.

### **On Death**

 - Not fully convinced by the idea of death. How selfish of me!
 - One of my aims is to find a way to make us humans connect on a deeper level using technology. Oxymoronic, right? Being together in a state of a continuous flow of essences juggling and understanding one another just by learning how to leverage compressed communication?
 - I do enjoy thinking about [Longtermism](craftdocs://open?blockId=B16D5BE5-C84D-4A4F-96FC-76EE51E34AAD&spaceId=78991a71-3e99-e195-9b3c-47bb26f1e234)

### **Karmic Guidelines?**

 - I have what you might call karmic guidelines and I tend to sometimes believe in this type of framework as I find it helpful for me rebounding from challenges in life and for making moral decisions.
 - I am also quite attached to science, which is really a regimented way of testing your own assumptions. It's not sterile. It's a way of thinking that I find very helpful for avoiding confusion and delusion.
 - So having spent so much time in that evidence-based world and manner and investigation and thinking, I try not to accumulate that many beliefs that I can't show evidence for.
 - Karma is about patterns of behavior that repeat. Repeating patterns of behavior are real, just as that the same kind of people are drawn to each other. Violent people find themselves together, where often they prey upon one another. That many become victims is said to be karma. The world needs not to be random. The world does not care what I want.

### **Other conditions**

 - [Schizoid personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoid_personality_disorder) (not)
 - [Neurodivergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodiversity)
 - [Alexithymia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia)
 - @INTJ  
 - not too sociable but have social skills
 - have empathy but also active/assertive
 - decent at changing plans instead of sticking to one 'perfect plan'
 - Choleric-Melancholic

### **Questions from the community**

 These are some common questions I collected from my community. Posting the answer here, as it might be helpful for other people too.  


 **How do you DISCOVER content? (Sources) E.g. Twitter / other newsletters/recommendations from friends / Feedly, and any other sources?**

 I am pretty random in terms of how I discover content. Over the years, I've built a steady mental list of people/blogs/distribution channels that I follow either via email or, again, mentally. Meaning that I actively remind myself to check X's blog and see if any new posts have been published or something that might be interesting for my purposes. I do sometimes collect content from Twitter, but again, most of it is collected actively by myself by actually going to the source. If I decide that the source is reliable, I will subscribe to their communications (daily/weekly/monthly newsletters, updates & other news types from that particular creator/outlet).

**How and where do you SAVE the content you find interesting? E.g. Pocket, Notion, Roam, etc.**

 ~~I save content in Notion (with Notion Web Clipper) and Roam. I used Pocket in the past, as well as Evernote. I am also experimenting with a currently Apple-only browser called Command.~~

 **Update** [Mon, 7 Nov](day://2022.11.07)


  - now using [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.app)

**Do you typically WRITE thoughts/ insights/ views on the content while saving the content or later when you are writing the newsletter? What app do you write these thoughts to?**

 When I find something interesting, I either send it to a Notion folder called "Links to process". This means that I will have to schedule some time during the week to read that particular piece and decide if it is worth sharing or not. I would also leave a tab open in the browser, schedule a reminder using my iOS Reminders app, or even post it in my calendar so that I can read the content the next day (say I discover something right before sleep haha). You can check my favorite collected links (in Notion) [here](https://www.notion.so/Robert-s-Digital-Mind-Palace-4b5b80e26c6140f4802df2465662ba57).

**How do you CURATE i.e. decide which content goes into the newsletter? What do you use for the actual shortlisting? E.g. Pocket, Notion, Roam.**

 Nowadays, I keep the things that interest me in Notion, and I have shared that folder with my community. I have a category-based substructure where I keep things such as Interesting Articles, Software, Blogs I follow, Marketing Stuff, Design, etc. I read -> Save to Notion's Links to Process -> Follow-up and do the Processing -> Post it in the newsletter while adding some personal notes.

**What is the most annoying part of the curation process? What would make your life easier?**

 I would not say there's anything annoying. To speed up the process, it would have been great if [Substack](https://kbottle.substack.com/welcome) had an actual app so that I could send my desired content straight into the future 'newsletter' as a plain-text link.

**Do you typically write your newsletter on another note-taking app and paste into Substack or write it on Substack itself?**

 ~~No, I use~~ ~~[Substack](https://kbottle.substack.com/welcome)~~~~ exclusively for writing.~~

 **Update** **[Mon, 7 Nov](day://2022.11.07)**


  - I am using Craft to write my newsletter and move the content to Substack

**What parts of the curation process you wished were easier/ better?**

 I think that the answer from #5 would apply here as well.

**How do you deal with FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)? I have so many YouTube videos that could help improve my life, but it's kind of too much.**

 Constant battles. Unsubscribe from everything (cold turkey) and possibly make a list of channels you would like to review/watch something like 1x per week. Or even 1x per day! IF 1 week is too hard. You can also create a secondary account so that you can get a fresh feed, getting rid of the old one, which is going to be affected by its own history.

**Do you have any tips for me on how I could tell more people about my project?**

 If you haven't already, I would first start creating a structure, a plan of attack. It's sort of like setting up your cockpit first and then flying the plane.

 From the top of my mind:


  1. Discord communities
  2. Telegram communities
  3. WhatsApp communities (not sure if this exist lol)
  4. Clubhouse communities
  5. Reddit communities
  6. Slack communities
  7. Hackernews
  8. Hackernoon
  9. Indiechakers
  10. Blogging/documenting your process/outcome
  11. Recycling the (7) post on Medium (debatable)
  12. [Newsletter](https://kbottle.substack.com/welcome) (should not be focused on pushing your products)
  13. Twitter
  14. Instagram
  15. Pinterest
  16. Facebook
  17. [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Blanc-5) *(try to be helpful)*
  18. Merge all of the above under one single account an push what you want to push through these so that you don't have to publish on each individually. There should be a balance here, as not every single piece of content is suited for every platform.
  19. Synthesize your projects under a small easy to digest link using something like [luma](https://www.instagram.com/robsblanc/) or [nano.site](https://nano.site/). I'm sure there are others out there. Attach that link to your social media profiles and other places you hang out on the internet.

 There is no one-size-fits-all recipe. Also, a marathon, not a sprint. Tactical consistency cooks the rice.

### **You sure have a knack for discovering obscure methods to optimize everyday processes. I want to know the processes you follow to deconstruct any skill to the bare minimum.**

 to be answered formally*

### **On teaching children**

 I hesitate to over-advise since each child is unique. Not much I would force on them. Not over-optimized, and not over-calculated. I would allow them to follow their own natural curiosities i.e. Do not force children to learn an instrument just for the sake of it.


 - Observing nature and asking leading questions to get information and put forward and articulate the details of what they see.
 - Talk about how curiosity beats academia. Curiosity is the ultimate catalyst of learning. See Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Richard Feynman.
 - Talk with them about what a paradox is. Paradox stimulates puzzle-solving. ex: "Don't go in the water until you have learned how to swim. (How can you learn to swim if you never go in the water?)”
 - On playing games: For youngsters, Zendo seems to be an enjoyable game that provides essential lessons about creating and evaluating hypotheses. You can also bring some games such as chess, go + other board games, etc.
 - Journaling: but focus on explaining that they do not need to do it in a structured fashion. Simply dumping your leftover thoughts on a piece of paper (analog/digital) will suffice. You can doodle, tear down the paper, paint, or write — but explain why it is important for reflection.
 - Exceptional characters are built in solitude, but not in complete isolation. Having time to develop oneself away from pressure and other people’s insecurities bleeding over. Socialization can be triggered through other means.
 - I would focus on basic literacy, foundational math, logic, computer science, web3 concepts (very early)
 - On reading - talk with them about what they enjoy and ask: have you ever thought about reading about X? Read what you live until you love how to read. Reading is everywhere. Make them aware that they are actually reading every single day. One can develop speed-reading/comprehension mini-competitions and see who gets the gist of a message faster. Reading is good, but forcing people to read is not.
 - Leadership by example. We need more leaders.
 - Talk about how reading, speaking, and writing can make you deadly in the world.
 - Ultimately talking about doing things that can increase one’s optionality.

 This list will expand as I will create more thoughts about raising children.

 Update [Fri, 21 Oct](day://2022.10.21)


 - In the past couple of months, I had a thought: what would it be like to teach a class myself?

### **How do you figure things out when you feel you are stuck and lost?**

 Sad time/empty time has the potential to be filled with great things.

 Generally — times of distress — have no desire to do anything other than wallow in my misery.

 Nonetheless, I focus on the small things I can control. I brush my teeth, prepare nutritious food, wash the dishes, pay the bills, take my vitamins, tidy the house, and go to bed early despite my symptoms of sadness.

 These duties are so insignificant, but they allow me to maintain a sense of control over my life. When my daily chores are completed, my mind is less diverted by other thoughts.

### **How did you learn to create [this](https://www.instagram.com/visualtheory_/) kind of content?**

 I was always a design aficionado, especially the minimalist kind. I remember that I first started playing with shapes in something like PowerPoint when I was younger. It later led me to other pieces of software, and I started experimenting. I usually write and then try to sum up my scribbles using a compressed design that can, hopefully, describe the whole piece.

### **How can we deal with people who treat us with disloyal behavior?**

 The more you engage with toxic people, the deeper you go in their world.

 You have a limited amount of space.

 Remove somebody that you once felt close to can be terrifying, but that space will allow you to grow.

 That space can be later filled with a new healthier more positive relationship or more space for yourself.

 Toxicity requires clean-up (awareness).

 Everything begins with awareness.

### **Change my view**

 I am always looking for counter-points.

 This is why I have built a community around me where I can have conversations so that I can change my view on various topics.

**CMV**: As we advance as a civilization, defence tends to win over offence

 **I feel that as societies evolve, they tend to become more focused on defence instead of offence.**

 A few examples:


 - it seems that offensive forces generally have the upper hand since it is simpler to create a weapon that can destroy a large number of smaller ones than the opposite, but the technology required to intercept and destroy is much more complicated than the technology to simply blow things up;
 - it is generally more useful to avoid a fight instead of engaging into a street-fight; I am not sure about the stats here, but isn't the person who throws the first punch most at fault?
 - it seems like cryptography is about living in a world where defense wins
 - being the one who's doing less talking and more listening is receiving input instead of expelling input; being a good listener is about learning how to make space for another person’s worries, thoughts, ideas, and words and oftentimes sacrificing your own

 I should be able to come up with more examples as this post evloves, but I was wondering what are your thoughts around this.
